In the entire purchasing department, 479,700 requisitions have been created since 2018. That is a lot of requisitions.

## What is the Total Amounts of All Requisitions Overall?
 
The amount from all the requisitions adds up to a total of $4,689,165,959.68. So, all departments at ASU spent a total of almost 5 billion dollars since the start of fiscal year 2018.

## How Many Requisitions Were Processed Under $25,000 ?

All Departments submitted 463,248 requisitions that were under $25,000. These requisitions are easy in that they need less documentation so these can be processed very quickly. These take up most of the requisitions overall.

## What is The Total Amount of All Requisitions Under $25,000 ?
 
Departments spent around $702,508,727.80 on orders that are under $25,000.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $25,000 ?
 
All Departments submitted 16,452 requisitions that were over $25,000. Do not let the small number fool you. These orders require more documentation, so these require us to wait for the department to reach back out for the required documentation. These even take longer if the requisitions use federal funding. These take longer to do.

## What Is the Total Amount of All Requisitions Over $25,000 ?
 
Departments spent around $3,986,657,231.88 on orders that are over $25,000.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed between $25,000 and $100,000 ?
 
All Departments submitted 11,952 requisitions that were between $25,000 and $100,000. Strategic Partnerships always process these orders, and these are orders that we should always learn and get better at these. They require more documentation and waiting so these most of the time cannot be processed right away so there is a lot of waiting. These are the types of requisitions Strategic Partnerships always prioritizes. MRO teams sometimes do these amounts. The sourcing team never do this amount since they are over $100,000 and rarely construction team process these requisitions.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $100,000 ?
 
All Departments submitted 4,574 requisitions that were over $100,000. These requisitions require suppliers that have formal solicitations or have a sole source. Departments really have to check if an order is going to go over $100,000

## What Is the Total Amount of All Requisitions Over $100,000 ?
 
Departments spent around $3,400,642,325.94 on orders that are over $100,000.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $1,000,000 ?
 
All Departments submitted 412 requisitions that were over $1,000,000. These are treated as requisitions over $100,000. This is a lot of many so purchasing must be careful and not make any mistakes on these purchases.

## What Is the Total Amount of All Requisitions Over $1,000,000 ?
 
Departments spent around $2,293,023,530.86 on orders that are over $1,000,000.

## What is the Requisition Lowest Amount ?
 
The lowest amount on a requisition is -11.96 or around -$12 dollars. This means that the requisition had so many discounts to the point where the supplier gave back the department 12 dollars.

## What Kind of Requisition Is the Lowest Amount ?
 
This is a pay an invoice requisition. From pulling this up in Workday. This requisition is textbook purchases for student athletes each team like Football Basketball Baseball etc. for SDA. There were around 13 discounts out of 21 different teams that had textbook purchases for student athletes that made the total on the requisition around -12 dollars. Note this is the only requisition with a negative amount.

## What Is the Requisition Highest Amount ?
 
The highest amount on a requisition is $139,066,673. That is a lot of money for a purchase. I am guessing this is a construction purchase

## What Kind of Requisition Is the Highest Amount ?
 
This requisition is for construction services for the new building lab called Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building (ISTB 12) at the Polytechnic campus. There is probably lots of fancy lab equipment that needs to be installed. Anything with science orders is more expensive.

## What is the Average Total Amount of Requisitions Overall ?
 
Is around $9775.21. This proves most requisitions are low dollar.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Goods and Services ?
 
Departments have submitted around 337,564 requisitions totaling around $2,137,782,764.41 that uses the requisition type of Goods and Services. This is an important requisition type. This requisition type generates a purchase order after a requisition gets approved to go to supplier as a contract and the supplier automatically accepts ASU terms and conditions. When a supplier disagrees with some or all of the ASU terms and conditions in the PO, the supplier will create a contract with their terms and conditions and purchasing will sign off adding ASU terms and conditions and if the supplier still disagrees, the contracts team will specialize in negotiations of the contracts. The purchase order protects ASU and departments if the orders or services go wrong. The total amount for each requisition type is from a query that is coming up.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Technology ?
 
Departments have submitted around 34,674 requisitions totaling around $593,431,625.50 that uses the requisition type of Technology. Technology operates the same way as using Goods and Services. What makes this requisition type different is that these require security review so these will be provided in requisition before or after approval but are provided before the orders need payment. Pay an invoice of technology purchases has a security review alert so the orders get counted under the requisition type of Pay an Invoice. Sometimes these orders will have suppliers wanting subscription agreements signed so the purchasing department must be very careful with what they agree to because their amounts are more, they have terms for 1 to the max of 5 years and many more supplier terms and conditions. Subscription contracts are the contracts that purchasing must be the most careful on.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Pay an Invoice ?
 
Departments have submitted around 60,890 requisitions totaling around $353,743,777.07 that uses the requisition type of Pay an Invoice. Pay in Invoice is used when a service is done after the fact and the services needed to get paid. In the past, there were many departments that would skip over to using Pay an Invoice used of using Goods and Services generating a PO. This is an issue because if the supplier has any issues, they can point to the PO, but if the PO is not there, then that is on the department. We always want departments for us to generate the PO before creating a requisition to pay an invoice.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used Many Requisition Types Instead of the Ones Mentioned Above ?
 
Departments have submitted around 46,389 requisitions totaling around $1,134,160,935.89 that uses the requisition types other than Goods and Services, Pay an Invoice, and technology. Construction and MRO team are the ones that use the other requisition types. My team in strategic partnerships will rarely use the Chemical requisition type and those get routed to materials management after approval. The department chooses a requisition type based on the purchases and that requisition will route to a purchasing team based on the requisition type. Departments should always reach out to purchasing if they are not too sure if the requisition type is the right one.

## What are the Different Types of Requisition Types Being Used ?
 
There are 17 different types of Requisition type is displayed in a table
## What are the Top 17 Requisition Types by Count from Largest to Smallest with Their Total Amounts Included not in Order ?
 
The results match some of the questions of finding how many requisitions were processed using different Requisition Types. The Top 3 Requisition Types by count are Goods and Services, Pay an Invoice, and Technology. My team strategic partnerships and the sourcing team deals with these requisition types the most on a daily basis. MRO team deals with non-stock facilities and inventory replenishment. Chemical and Specialty Gas goes to materials management. Construction team deals with the rest and those require different documentations and requirements based on the purchase
## What are the Top 17 Requisition Type Total Amounts from Largest to Smallest with Their Total Number of Requisitions Included not in Order ?
 
Goods and Services is on the top since this a requisition type department should always use to generate PO before using Pay in Invoice to pay for the purchase. Many requisition types start appearing near the top that deal with construction due to the nature of their purchases. These purchases absolutely need a Purchase Order generated in order to protect the departments especially with how expensive these purchases order.

## What are the Top Requestors by the Total Number of Requisitions Submitted using HAVING clause?
 
There are 5,248 different Requesters purchasing dealt with since 2018. They represent different departments across ASU such as SDA, President’s Office, Ira Fulton, WP Carey, Mary Lou, CPMG, Materials Management and many more. The top one works in Materials Management. It is some materials management, but the rest are a variety of departments. Purchasing knows these names by repetition since their titles do not appear in Workday. We must search for their emails personally. It is cool to see what type of order different departments do.
## How Many Requisitions Went to the Purchasing Department since 2018 ?
 
84363 requisitions went to and were processed by purchasing. This shows not all requisitions go to purchasing. Some suppliers are set up a certain way where department orders do not get routed to purchasing which is called a catalog or punchout order. This only happens when a supplier has a contract with ASU and has gone through the RFP process. 400,000 requisitions would be too much for purchasing to handle so it is the best to get as many suppliers as possible to have a contract and RFP with ASU to make the purchasing process much easier.

## What Are Some Busy Months for Purchasing by Year
 
This shows how busy it is for both departments and purchasing. It gives an idea of when all departments are likely to purchase things. All the other months vary depending on any department’s needs.
The busiest month is late summer which is the month July, August, and September. The reason is that it is the start of the new fiscal year. So, departments create requisitions for a purchase order to be issued for a contract to be made with the supplier so the departments can pay the supplier invoices later using a pay an invoice requisition. It would be about every single department creating requisitions for those to get approved by purchasing the amount of requisitions that reach purchasing during the new fiscal year is enormous. Another reason is that departments spend money on stuff needed for the new school year.
The least busy months are December and June. The reason for December is because departments would have already been purchasing things needed for the spring school year so it would be departments trying to pay invoices and most of the faculty is and staff will be on holidays and some days the university would be closed so there is less staff at the University during the month of December. The reason for June is the end of a fiscal year overall. Departments want to issue new purchase orders for the new fiscal year, but they are unable to do it until the first day of July and departments are busy doing whatever the need to do for financial wise year end, so they are less likely to create requisitions during the month of June.

## What is the Total Number of Requisitions per year since 2018 ?
 
* 2018 – 41652 Requisitions
* 2019 – 85793 Requisitions
* 2020 – 66905 Requisitions
* 2021 – 74310 Requisitions
* 2022 – 82084 Requisitions
* 2023 – 86228 Requisitions
* 2024 – 42728 Requisitions

There is a trend with the number of requisitions processes yearly. 2018 is when Workday was first implemented so the number of requisitions is the lowest for that reason. 2019 is the year where the requisitions were processed the most pre pandemic. There were a lot of students enrolled so departments have the funding to spend their money. Purchasing was busy during that year. 2020 is where everything changed. 2020 has the lowest number of requisitions processed. The reason for that huge decline from 2019 is that the pandemic had occurred. ASU had to basically go online, and the university was almost shut down in many ways. Campus was very empty. Because there were not as many students on campus, departments did not really spend as much of their money. As the pandemic started to subside, there number of requisitions started to increase every single year. 2023 has the most requisitions processed. This is the year where the university felt normal before the pandemic.

## What is the Total Amount of all Requisitions per year since 2018 ?
 
* 2018 – $348,200,512.82 All Departments spent around 348 million dollars this year in 2018.
* 2019 – $727,505,051.34 All Departments spent around 727 million dollars this year in 2019.
* 2020 – $579,614,994.83 All Departments spent around 580 million dollars this year in 2020.
* 2021 – $674,442,522.28 All Departments spent around 674 million dollars this year in 2021.
* 2022 – $840,200,641.57 All Departments spent around 840 million dollars this year in 2022.
* 2023 – $1,049,170,380.17 All Departments spent around 1 billion dollars this year in 2023.
* 2024 – $470,047,046.08 All Departments spent around 470 million dollars this year in 2023.

The trend is just the same as the number of requisitions departments submitted and processed. Department spends lots of money until the pandemic hits in 2020 where ASU is kind of shut down. As the pandemic ends, the spending slowly increases and now in 2023, All departments spend over 1 billion dollars on anything for ASU. I predict all departments will spend even more money in the future. Conclusion Since there is no pandemic now, I believe ASU will increase the enrollment. More enrollment means more tuition means more money, meaning departments must purchase things that will go to the purchasing team that will keep us busy. I predict that more requisitions will be processed in 2024 than this year 2023. I believe there will be more Purchase Orders issued in 2024 than 2023. I also believe that departments will spend even more money on Goods/Services, Scientific, Technology, and Construction purchases. I predict every year purchases will increase but more slowly in the long run.
rchases will increase but more slowly in the long run.
