## Procurement Specialist Role
My role title is a Strategic Partnerships Procurement Specialist. My role is to assist departments with purchasing goods and services. I will answer department emails on purchasing related questions and either answer them or guide them to the right person and department. My main job is to process requisitions. Requisition means a request to order the goods or services from the department.
The Job of the purchasing department is to for departments to provide documentation that their purchase complies with the law and the purchasing manual. That is what a procurement method is, and we try to find a procurement method for a departmentâ€™s purchase. If the departments provide the right documentation, we use a procurement method and then we generate POs for the supplier and have terms and conditions in which the supplier accepts. This role is basically purchasing compliance. There is a Construction and Sourcing team. Before the purchasing reorganization before fiscal year 2023 the teams within Purchasing were 
Goods/Services, Technology, Scientific, and Construction.

## Diving into the Purchasing Requisitions
I am going to talk about the number of requisitions and their amount that have been processed in the past from 2018 year by year going from all purchasing to strategic partnerships which is the team I am in, to specially myself by creating data vizualization  and answer some questions using using data visuzulauzation that is created using PowerBi.

## What is the Total Number of Requisitions Overall ?


<img width="514" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions since 2018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6711fac0-47b3-4fb1-9838-fcef5ed7b01f">


In the entire purchasing department, **479,700** requisitions have been created since 2018. That is a lot of requisitions.


## What is the Total Amounts of All Requisitions Overall?


<img width="589" alt="Total Amount of all Requisitions since 2018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a1388c8-19e1-49b2-8bb8-21981af6380d">

 
The amount from all the requisitions adds up to a total of **$4,689,165,959.68.** So, all departments at ASU spent a total of almost 5 billion dollars since the start of fiscal year 2018.


## How Many Requisitions Were Processed Under $25,000 ?


<img width="511" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions under 25,000-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b76f468-6c5c-4ccf-a51b-dbea02cda48d">


All Departments submitted **463,248** requisitions that were under $25,000. These requisitions are easy in that they need less documentation so these can be processed very quickly. These take up most of the requisitions overall.

<img width="525" alt="Total Amount of all Requisitions under 25,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd910b74-4048-4ebc-a761-4061bbe94f89">

 
Departments spent around **$702,508,727.80** on orders that are under $25,000.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $25,000 ?


 <img width="509" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions over 25,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/849a4902-1366-4394-9b83-2015ba271a2e">


All Departments submitted **16,452** requisitions that were over $25,000. Do not let the small number fool you. These orders require more documentation, so these require us to wait for the department to reach back out for the required documentation. These even take longer if the requisitions use federal funding. These take longer to do.


## What Is the Total Amount of All Requisitions Over $25,000 ?


<img width="596" alt="Total Amount of all Requisitions over 25,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/594cff8b-ff1b-454f-80c5-af2b557deffa">

 
Departments spent around **$3,986,657,231.88** on orders that are over $25,000.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed between $25,000 and $100,000 ?


<img width="1464" alt="Total Number Amount of all Requisitions between 25,000 100,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34ca4a5e-8416-416f-8e5a-1d7021192a27">

 
All Departments submitted **11,952** requisitions that were between $25,000 and $100,000. Strategic Partnerships always process these orders, and these are orders that we should always learn and get better at these. They require more documentation and waiting so these most of the time cannot be processed right away so there is a lot of waiting. These are the types of requisitions Strategic Partnerships always prioritizes. MRO teams sometimes do these amounts. The sourcing team never do this amount since they are over $100,000 and rarely construction team process these requisitions.


## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $100,000 ?


<img width="347" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions over 100,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd7a069d-56b9-42f0-85a4-4b06b5e51ad9">

 
All Departments submitted **4,574** requisitions that were over $100,000. These requisitions require suppliers that have formal solicitations or have a sole source. Departments really have to check if an order is going to go over $100,000

Departments spent around **$3,400,642,325.94** on orders that are over $100,000.


## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $1,000,000 ?


<img width="488" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions over 1,000,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f376459c-c8c2-44c8-ad98-b866a02d5a5c">

 
All Departments submitted **412** requisitions that were over $1,000,000. These are treated as requisitions over $100,000. This is a lot of many so purchasing must be careful and not make any mistakes on these purchases.

<img width="559" alt="Total Amount of all Requisitions over 1,000,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ae737da-916a-49fb-a8a9-4da9dedec712">

 
Departments spent around **$2,293,023,530.86** on orders that are over $1,000,000.

## What is the Requisition Lowest Amount ?


<img width="1467" alt="Requisitions lowest amount" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c56c15-1d74-4a80-bd72-f88653ed7aa4">


The lowest amount on a requisition is **-11.96** or around -$12 dollars. This means that the requisition had so many discounts to the point where the supplier gave back the department 12 dollars. This is a pay an invoice requisition. From pulling this up in Workday. This requisition is textbook purchases for student athletes each team like Football Basketball Baseball etc. for SDA. There were around 13 discounts out of 21 different teams that had textbook purchases for student athletes that made the total on the requisition around -12 dollars. Note this is the only requisition with a negative amount.


## What Is the Requisition Highest Amount ?


<img width="1467" alt="Requisitions highest amount" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5524c659-678e-4c0f-bf5a-78371d304287">

The highest amount on a requisition is $139,066,673. That is a lot of money for a purchase. I am guessing this is a construction purchase. This requisition is for construction services for the new building lab called Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building (ISTB 12) at the Polytechnic campus. There is probably lots of fancy lab equipment that needs to be installed. Anything with science orders is more expensive.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Goods and Services ?


<img width="1464" alt="Total Number Amount of all Requisitions that used Goods and Services" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fcc898d-7888-45df-9a00-d77038a0d568">


Departments have submitted around **337,564** requisitions totaling around $2,394,036,134.45 that uses the requisition type of Goods and Services. This is an important requisition type. This requisition type generates a purchase order after a requisition gets approved to go to supplier as a contract and the supplier automatically accepts ASU terms and conditions. When a supplier disagrees with some or all of the ASU terms and conditions in the PO, the supplier will create a contract with their terms and conditions and purchasing will sign off adding ASU terms and conditions and if the supplier still disagrees, the contracts team will specialize in negotiations of the contracts. The purchase order protects ASU and departments if the orders or services go wrong. The total amount for each requisition type is from a query that is coming up.


## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Technology ?


<img width="1466" alt="Total Number Amount of all Requisitions that used Technology" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0788c1a1-e4ef-4a6f-97df-5b2e7dc436dc">


Departments have submitted around **34,674** requisitions totaling around $659,388,048.89 that uses the requisition type of Technology. Technology operates the same way as using Goods and Services. What makes this requisition type different is that these require security review so these will be provided in requisition before or after approval but are provided before the orders need payment. Pay an invoice of technology purchases has a security review alert so the orders get counted under the requisition type of Pay an Invoice. Sometimes these orders will have suppliers wanting subscription agreements signed so the purchasing department must be very careful with what they agree to because their amounts are more, they have terms for 1 to the max of 5 years and many more supplier terms and conditions. Subscription contracts are the contracts that purchasing must be the most careful on.


## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Pay an Invoice ?


<img width="1462" alt="Total Number Amount of all Requisitions that used Pay an Invoice" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbe2c45c-f8eb-4a74-b35c-23169755cd97">


Departments have submitted around **60,890** requisitions totaling around $396,948,701.58 that uses the requisition type of Pay an Invoice. Pay in Invoice is used when a service is done after the fact and the services needed to get paid. In the past, there were many departments that would skip over to using Pay an Invoice used of using Goods and Services generating a PO. This is an issue because if the supplier has any issues, they can point to the PO, but if the PO is not there, then that is on the department. We always want departments for us to generate the PO before creating a requisition to pay an invoice.


## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used Many Requisition Types Instead of the Ones Mentioned Above ?


<img width="1466" alt="Total Number Amount of all Requisitions that used other" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/136f4ed6-7827-4eef-af39-e6018b0fee46">


Departments have submitted around **46,389** requisitions totaling around $1,238,703,045.59 that uses the requisition types other than Goods and Services, Pay an Invoice, and technology. Construction and MRO team are the ones that use the other requisition types. My team in strategic partnerships will rarely use the Chemical requisition type and those get routed to materials management after approval. The department chooses a requisition type based on the purchases and that requisition will route to a purchasing team based on the requisition type. Departments should always reach out to purchasing if they are not too sure if the requisition type is the right one.


## How Many Requisitions Went to the Purchasing Department since 2018 ?


<img width="1464" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions that went to purchasing" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4deec25-3e67-4bdd-9daf-70a908b108ba">


**84,363** requisitions totaling $3,754,555,901.48 went to and were processed by purchasing. This shows not all requisitions go to purchasing. Some suppliers are set up a certain way where department orders do not get routed to purchasing which is called a catalog or punchout order. This only happens when a supplier has a contract with ASU and has gone through the RFP process. 400,000 requisitions would be too much for purchasing to handle so it is the best to get as many suppliers as possible to have a contract and RFP with ASU to make the purchasing process much easier.


## What Are Some Busy Months for Purchasing Overall


<img width="829" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions per month since 2018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aac4bda-6cd0-49d3-a40b-64d64d5abf83">


This shows how busy it is for both departments and purchasing. It gives an idea of when all departments are likely to purchase things. All the other months vary depending on any departmentâ€™s needs.

The busiest month is late summer which is the month July, August, and September. The reason is that it is the start of the new fiscal year. So, departments create requisitions for a purchase order to be issued for a contract to be made with the supplier so the departments can pay the supplier invoices later using a pay an invoice requisition. Many requisitions have purchases that are for a 1-year terms for example subscriptions. For those a PO must be generated during the new fiscal year It would be about every single department creating requisitions for those to get approved by purchasing the amount of requisitions that reach purchasing during the new fiscal year is enormous. Another reason is that departments spend money on stuff needed for the new school year

The least busy months are December and June. The reason for December is because departments would have already been purchasing things needed for the spring school year so it would be departments trying to pay invoices and most of the faculty is and staff will be on holidays and some days the university would be closed so there is less staff at the University during the month of December. The reason for June is the end of a fiscal year overall. Departments want to issue new purchase orders for the new fiscal year, but they are unable to do it until the first day of July and departments are busy doing whatever the need to do for financial wise year end, so they are less likely to create requisitions during the month of June.

Busy months by amount is july is becasue the dollar amounts need to br high. All the other months can be either departments paying the invoices or genearteing PO that doesnt have the tertms. Juanry is the second busiest month becasue departments needs to purchaes things for the sprinf school years. All other months vary depending on the depatment needs


<img width="831" alt="Total Amount of all Requisitions per month since 2018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58032137-a479-46b9-8b8e-6ae5481f0e11">

The busiest month by requisition amount overall is July because of the new fiscal year. January is the second busiest month because many departments need to purchase things for the spring school year. All other months vary depending on the departmentâ€™s needs. 

## What Are Some Busy Months for Purchasing Department

<img width="1466" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions that went to purchasing per month" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fe02628-68cb-4fc7-905a-ad4c341d6648">

July is the busiest becasue the of the new fiscal year. So, departments create requisitions for a purchase order to be issued for a contract to be made with the supplier so the departments can pay the supplier invoices later using a pay an invoice requisition. Becasue of the dollar amount, majority of the requistions will route to purchasing for approvals. In amounts July is still the highest one just like . The lowest amount is novmeber becasue departmetns are trying to pay the invopioces. Requsityosn get roted to purchsing based on the amount, if it uses federal funds, and the supplier since some suppliers that have contracts with ASU that has a catalog will not route to us and if the invoice from purchase orders needs to get paid.

## What is the Total Number of Requisitions per year since 2018 ?


<img width="832" alt="Total Number of all Requisitions per year since 2018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b4df40e-daee-42b4-a6a8-5eb23411a95a">


* 2018 â€“ **41,652** Requisitions
* 2019 â€“ **85,793** Requisitions
* 2020 â€“ **66,905** Requisitions
* 2021 â€“ **74,310** Requisitions
* 2022 â€“ **82,084** Requisitions
* 2023 â€“ **86,228** Requisitions
* 2024 â€“ **42,728** Requisitions

There is a trend with the number of requisitions processes yearly. 2018 is when Workday was first implemented so the number of requisitions is the lowest for that reason. 2019 is the year where the requisitions were processed the most pre pandemic. There were a lot of students enrolled so departments have the funding to spend their money. Purchasing was busy during that year. 2020 is where everything changed. 2020 has the lowest number of requisitions processed. The reason for that huge decline from 2019 is that the pandemic had occurred. ASU had to basically go online, and the university was almost shut down in many ways. Campus was very empty. Because there were not as many students on campus, departments did not really spend as much of their money. As the pandemic started to subside, there number of requisitions started to increase every single year. 2023 has the most requisitions processed. This is the year where the university felt normal before the pandemic.


## What is the Total Amount of all Requisitions per year since 2018 ?


<img width="827" alt="Total Amount of all Requisitions per year since 2018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d7c7c35-ef3e-44a3-9b76-b8c5b426c87e">


* 2018 â€“ **$348,200,512.82** All Departments spent around 348 million dollars this year in 2018.
* 2019 â€“ **$727,505,051.34** All Departments spent around 727 million dollars this year in 2019.
* 2020 â€“ **$579,614,994.83** All Departments spent around 580 million dollars this year in 2020.
* 2021 â€“ **$674,442,522.28** All Departments spent around 674 million dollars this year in 2021.
* 2022 â€“ **$840,200,641.57** All Departments spent around 840 million dollars this year in 2022.
* 2023 â€“ **$1,049,170,380.17** All Departments spent around 1 billion dollars this year in 2023.
* 2024 â€“ **$470,047,046.08** All Departments spent around 470 million dollars this year in 2023.


The trend is just the same as the number of requisitions departments submitted and processed. Department spends lots of money until the pandemic hits in 2020 where ASU is kind of shut down. As the pandemic ends, the spending slowly increases and now in 2023, All departments spend over 1 billion dollars on anything for ASU. I predict all departments will spend even more money in the future. Conclusion Since there is no pandemic now, I believe ASU will increase the enrollment. More enrollment means more tuition means more money, meaning departments must purchase things that will go to the purchasing team that will keep us busy. I predict that more requisitions will be processed in 2024 than this year 2023. I believe there will be more Purchase Orders issued in 2024 than 2023. I also believe that departments will spend even more money on Goods/Services, Scientific, Technology, and Construction purchases. I predict every year purchases will increase but more slowly in the long run.
rchases will increase but more slowly in the long run.


# How Many Requisitions I have Processed since I started at ASU ?

<img width="511" alt="MY Requisitions Overall " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1f9b21d-4518-4035-bc87-ed4fbf386caf">


I have processed **6,706** requisitions since starting in the ASU purchasing department. That is a lot of requisitions processed. 

## What Is the Total Amount of All of the Requisitions I Have Processed Since Starting at ASU ?
<img width="490" alt="Total Amount of all MY Requisitions since 2018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94767f11-8af9-4940-98ca-19e116251be3">



Departments spent **$43,173,807.00** so around 25 million dollars with the requisitions that I have processed.

## How Many Requisitions That I have Processed That are Under $25,000?  

<img width="1465" alt="Total Number Amount of all MY Requisitions under $25,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6c43778-7a78-4840-8f37-45a7ba0cefb4">


I have processed **6,189** requisitions that are $25,000 and under. These represent most of the departmentâ€™s purchases. I have move away from processing these the longer I work in purchasing. If I do an under $25,000 requisitions, it would be the oldest one first

## What Is the Total Amount of All of the Requisitions I Have Processed That are Under $25,000?



Departments spent **$16,802,536.13** on purchases that goes to me under $25,000.

##  How Many Requisitions That I have Processed That are Over $25,000? 

<img width="1460" alt="Total Number Amount of all MY Requisitions over $25,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0791910-b9c6-40fe-ac69-c5e3e4c969ba">


I have processed **517** requisitions over $25,000. High dollars requisitions are more time consuming because they require more documentation and if the purchases use federal money, then even more documentation is needed so that the departments justify their purchase. That involves reaching out to the department to obtain more documentation. Processing high dollar requisitions is the biggest priority for the Strategic Partnerships team in that we get trained in how to do these first before going to low dollar. These requisitions have a steeper learning curve with learning which documentation is needed but are easy to master eventually. The hardest part is making sure departments have the right documentations because they donâ€™t always provide what we wanted.

The reason the number is lower because purchasing in general doesnâ€™t get a lot of high dollar requisitions in general. Departments would want a PO generated before creating separate requisitions usually low dollar to pay for invoices in which explains why Purchasing gets so many low dollar requisitions. Also, Strategic Partnerships is a huge team. Including myself there are 6 team members not including higher ups. And the work load gets evenly distributed and everyone in the team knows how to process over $25,000 requisitions. The number of requisitions has increased over time and will continue to increase in the future.

## What Is the Total Amount of All of the Requisitions I Have Processed That Are Over $25,000?



Departments spent **$26,371,270.87** on purchases that goes to me over $25,000.

## How Many Requisitions That I have Processed That are Over $100,000?

<img width="1460" alt="Total Number Amount of all MY Requisitions over $100,000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c47d4770-6e11-47b5-aa63-8a3e391e7bb5">


I have processed **zero** requisitions that are over $100,000. The reason for this is because requisitions over $100,000 do not go to our team in Strategic Partnerships. Those over $100,000 requisitions route over to the Sourcing Team in which they exclusively deal with over $100,000 requisitions.

## What Is the Requisition Lowest Amount I did?

<img width="1460" alt="MY Requisitions lowest amount" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26fcf27c-3989-4699-a545-7e39ef844b7f">

 
The lowest amount I have done on a requestions is **zero** dollars. Those requestions can either be a zero-dollar discount, Attachments or anything written the requisition needs to go to the suppler after the purchase order is generated, an agreement need to be signed and sent to the supplier or an agreement term needs to be extended. 


## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed That Used the Requisition Type of Goods and Services ?


<img width="1460" alt="Total Number Amount of all MY Requisitions that used Goods and Services" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7271f4c-d6fb-458f-ad7b-a2589f20e956">


For the Purchasing Department to generate purchase orders that is needed to go to the supplier that automatically accepts ASU terms and conditions in order to be used as a contract, departments will choose the requisition types of Goods and Services, Chemical, or Technology. I generated **1,103** Purchase Orders from requisitions that use Goods and Services. Strategic Partnerships donâ€™t get as much requisitions that uses goods and services because departments will sometimes want to purchase to issue Purchase Orders that are of high dollar amounts and then want to pay for each of the goods and services separately with the requisition type of Pay an Invoice.

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed That Used the Requisition Type of Technology?


<img width="1462" alt="Total Number Amount of all MY Requisitions that used Technology" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97d5adb9-923b-4dd4-bc7e-02b67ac78cc7">


I have processed **252** requisitions that use the requisition type of technology. That means 252 purchase orders have been issued. They are treated the same as goods and services, but they just require a security review while goods and services donâ€™t. 

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed That Used the Requisition Type of Pay an Invoice ?


<img width="1463" alt="Total Number Amount of all MY Requisitions that used Pay an Invoice" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/382b1e85-ba3f-43e5-a4d8-c23e043e9726">


A Pay an Invoice requisition type is used for purchases or services that have already happened. Suppliers will provide departments with an invoice and purchasing checks if departments provide an invoice document. I have done **5,279** requisitions that are Pay an Invoice any amounts. Purchasing must approve Pay an Invoice requisition for departments to pay for their purchases. Pay an Invoice is that requestion type that I approved the most. The Pay an Invoice requisitions is the requisition type that our team Strategic Partnerships sees the most. Purchasing always want departments to generate PO before using Pay an Invoice.

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed That Used Other Requisition Types?

<img width="1459" alt="Total Number Amount of all MY Requisitions that used other" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a64d5d43-4a01-44b9-9202-0be28691f306">


I have processed **72** requisitions of the other requisition types. All the other requestions type route to different teams within Purchasing. The only other requisition type that Strategic Partnerships do is Chemical. These go to material management after approval. The chemical orders are chemicals that are hazardous if people are not careful handling it. These requisitions are rare to see, but are treated just like a Goods and Services Requisitions. 

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed Every Year?


<img width="830" alt="Total Number of all MY Requisitions per year since 2018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea8a5039-7152-4604-b9b1-cbade8f19453">


* 2022 â€“ **2,069** requisitions have been processed by me in 2022
* 2023 â€“ **4,068** requisitions have been processed by me in 2023
* 2024 â€“ **569** requisitions have been processed by me in 2024

The trend is that the number of requisitions that I have been processing have increased. As years go on if I still stay in purchasing the number of requisitions that I have processed will plateau and stay close to the same because departments can only submit so many requisitions and I also have more teammates taking on requisitions other than myself.

## What Is the Total Amount for All the Requisitions I Have Processed Per Year ?

* 2022 â€“ Departments spent **$5,660,838.79** so around 6 million dollars with the requisitions that I have processed in 2022.
* 2023 â€“ Departments spent **$25,666,941.04** so around 26 million dollars with the requisitions that I have processed in 2023.
* 2024 â€“ Departments spent **$11,846,027.17** so around 12 million dollars with the requisitions that I have processed in 2024.
  
The trend is that the amounts from the requisitions are increasing every year. In the future the amounts will increase every year since I had taken on higher dollar requisitions.

# Conclusion

Since there is no pandemic now, I believe ASU will increase the enrollment. More enrollment means more tuition means more money, meaning departments must purchase things that will go to the purchasing team that will keep us busy. I predict that more requisitions will be processed in 2024 than this year 2023. I believe there will be more Purchase Orders issued in 2024 than 2023. I also believe that departments will spend even more money on Goods/Services, Scientific, Technology, and Construction purchases. I predict every year purchases will increase but more slowly in the long run.
