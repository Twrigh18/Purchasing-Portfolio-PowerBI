# Purchasing-Portfolio-PowerBI

## Procurement Specialist Role
My role title is a Strategic Partnerships Procurement Specialist. My role is to assist departments with purchasing goods and services. I will answer department emails on purchasing related questions and either answer them or guide them to the right person and department. My main job is to process requisitions. Requisition means a request to order the goods or services from the department.
The Job of the purchasing department is to for departments to provide documentation that their purchase complies with the law and the purchasing manual. That is what a procurement method is, and we try to find a procurement method for a departmentâ€™s purchase. If the departments provide the right documentation, we use a procurement method and then we generate POs for the supplier and have terms and conditions in which the supplier accepts. This role is basically purchasing compliance. There is a Construction and Sourcing team. Before the purchasing reorganization before fiscal year 2023 the teams within Purchasing were 
Goods/Services, Technology, Scientific, and Construction.

## Diving into the Purchasing Requisitions
I am going to talk about the number of requisitions and their amount that have been processed in the past from 2018 year by year going from all purchasing to strategic partnerships which is the team I am in, to specially myself by creating a dashboard in PowerBI and answering some question.

## What is the Total Number of Requisitions Overall ? 

In the entire purchasing department, **436971** requisitions have been created since 2018. That is a lot of requisitions.

## What is the Total Amounts of All Requisitions Overall?


The amount from all the requisitions adds up to a total of **$4,219,119,102.87**. So, all departments at ASU spent a total of around 4 billion dollars since the start of fiscal year 2018.

## How Many Requisitions Were Processed Under $25,000 ?


All Departments submitted **421,945** requisitions that were under $25,000. These requisitions are easy in that they need less documentation so these can be processed very quickly. These take up most of the requisitions overall.

## What is The Total Amount of All Requisitions Under $25,000 ?


Departments spent around **$638,388,640.23** on orders that are under $25,000.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $25,000 ?


All Departments submitted **15,026** requisitions that were over $25,000. Do not let the small number fool you. These orders require more documentation, so these require us to wait for the department to reach back out for the required documentation. These even take longer if the requisitions use federal funding. These take longer to do.

## What Is the Total Amount of All Requisitions Over $25,000 ?


Departments spent around **$3,580,730,462.64** on orders that are over $25,000.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed between $25,000 and $100,000 ?


All Departments submitted **10902** requisitions that were between $25,000 and $100,000. Strategic Partnerships always process these orders, and these are orders that we should always learn and get better at these. They require more documentation and waiting so these most of the time cannot be processed right away so there is a lot of waiting. These are the types of requisitions Strategic Partnerships always prioritizes. MRO teams sometimes do these amounts. The sourcing team never do this amount since they are over $100,000 and rarely construction team process these requisitions.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $100,000 ?

 
All Departments submitted **4,194** requisitions that were over $100,000. These requisitions require suppliers that have formal solicitations or have a sole source. Departments really have to check if an order is going to go over $100,000

## What Is the Total Amount of All Requisitions Over $100,000 ?


Departments spent around **$3,045,686,758.52** on orders that are over $100,000.

## How Many Requisitions were Processed Over $1,000,000 ?


All Departments submitted **379** requisitions that were over $1,000,000. These are treated as requisitions over $100,000. This is a lot of many so purchasing must be careful and not make any mistakes on these purchases.

## What Is the Total Amount of All Requisitions Over $1,000,000 ?

 
Departments spent around **$2,031,538,576.88** on orders that are over $1,000,000.

## What is the Requisition Lowest Amount ?

 
The lowest amount on a requisition is **-11.96** or around **-$12 dollars**. This means that the requisition had so many discounts to the point where the supplier gave back the department 12 dollars.

## What Kind of Requisition Is the Lowest Amount ?


This is a pay an invoice requisition. From pulling this up in Workday. This requisition is textbook purchases for student athletes each team like Football Basketball Baseball etc. for SDA. There were around 13 discounts out of 21 different teams that had textbook purchases for student athletes that made the total on the requisition around -12 dollars. Note this is the only requisition with a negative amount.

## What Is the Requisition Highest Amount ?


The highest amount on a requisition is **$139,066,673**. That is a lot of money for a purchase. I am guessing this is a construction purchase

## What Kind of Requisition Is the Highest Amount ?


This requisition is for construction services for the new building lab called Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building (ISTB 12) at the Polytechnic campus. There is probably lots of fancy lab equipment that needs to be installed. Anything with science orders is more expensive.

## What is the Average Total Amount of Requisitions Overall ?

Is around **$9655.38**. This proves most requisitions are low dollar.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Goods and Services ?

 
Departments have submitted around **309,641** requisitions totaling around $2,137,782,764.41 that uses the requisition type of Goods and Services. This is an important requisition type. This requisition type generates a purchase order after a requisition gets approved to go to supplier as a contract and the supplier automatically accepts ASU terms and conditions. When a supplier disagrees with some or all of the ASU terms and conditions in the PO, the supplier will create a contracts with their terms and conditions and purchasing will sign off adding ASU terms and conditions and if the supplier still disagrees, the contracts team will specialize in negotiations of the contracts. The purchase order protects ASU and departments if the orders or services go wrong. The total amount for each requisition type is from a query that is coming up.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Technology ?

 
Departments have submitted around **30,087** requisitions totaling around $593,431,625.50 that uses the requisition type of Technology. Technology operates the same way as using Goods and Services. What makes this requisition type different is that these require security review so these will be provided in requisition before or after approval but are provided before the orders need payment. Pay an invoice of technology purchases has a security review alert so the orders get counted under the requisition type of Pay an Invoice. Sometimes these orders will have suppliers wanting subscription agreements signed so the purchasing department must be very careful with what they agree to because their amounts are more, they have terms for 1 to the max of 5 years and many more supplier terms and conditions. Subscription contracts are the contracts that purchasing must be the most careful on.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used the Requisition Type of Pay an Invoice ?
 

Departments have submitted around **58,498** requisitions totaling around $353,743,777.07 that uses the requisition type of Pay an Invoice. Pay in Invoice is used when a service is done after the fact and the services needed to get paid. In the past, there were many departments that would skip over to using Pay an Invoice used of using Goods and Services generating a PO. This is an issue because if the supplier has any issues, they can point to the PO, but if the PO is not there, then that is on the department. We always want departments for us to generate the PO before creating  a requisition to pay an invoice.

## How Many Requisitions and Their Total Amounts Used Many Requisition Types Instead of the Ones Mentioned Above ?

 
Departments have submitted around **38,745** requisitions totaling around $1,134,160,935.89 that uses the requisition types other than Goods and Services, Pay an Invoice, and technology. Construction and MRO team are the ones that use the other requisition types. My team in strategic partnerships will rarely use the Chemical requisition type and those get routed to materials management after approval. The department chooses a requisition type based on the purchases and that requisition will route to a purchasing team based on the requisition type. Departments should always reach out to purchasing if they are not too sure if the requisition type is the right one.

## How Many Requisitions Used the Requisition Type of Pay an Invoice with the Requestors That Start With the Letter J ? 

 
There were **5019** Requisitions were processed answering this question

## How Many Requisitions Used the Requisition Type of Goods and Services with the Requestors That Start with the letter L and the Requisition Amounts That Are Over $25,000 ?

 
There were **697** Requisitions were processed answering this question

## How Many Requisitions Used the Requisition Type of Technology with the Requestors That Start with the Letters T, S, C, or P and the Requisition Amounts That Are Over $25,000 ? 


There were **72019** Requisitions that were processed answering this question

## What are the Different Types of Requisition Types Being Used ?


There are **17** different types of Requisition type is displayed in a table

## What are the Top 17 Requisition Types by Count from Largest to Smallest with Their Total Amounts Included not in Order ?

 
The results match some of the questions of finding how many requisitions were processed using different Requisition Types. The Top 3 Requisition Types by count are Goods and Services, Pay an Invoice, and Technology. My team strategic partnerships and the sourcing team deals with these requisition types the most on a daily basis. MRO team deals with non-stock facilities and inventory replenishment. Chemical and Specialty Gas goes to materials management. Construction team deals with the rest and those require different documentations and requirements based on the purchase

## What are the Top 17 Requisition Type Total Amounts from Largest to Smallest with Their Total Number of Requisitions Included not in Order ?

 
Goods and Services is on the top since this a requisition type department should always use to generate PO before using Pay in Invoice to pay for the purchase. Many requisition types start appearing near the top that deal with construction due to the nature of their purchases. These purchases absolutely need a Purchase Order generated in order to protect the departments especially with how expensive these purchases order.

## What are the Top Requestors by the Total Number of Requisitions Submitted using HAVING clause?

 
There are **4875** different Requesters purchasing dealt with since 2018. They represent different departments across ASU such as SDA, Presidentâ€™s Office, Ira Fulton, WP Carey, Mary Lou, CPMG, Materials Management and many more. The top one works in Materials Management. It is some materials management, but the rest are a variety of departments. Purchasing knows these names by repetition since their titles do not appear in Workday. We must search for their emails personally. It is cool to see what type of order different departments do.

## What is the Total Number of Requisitions per year since 2018 ?
 
* 2018 â€“ 41652 Requisitions
* 2019 â€“ 85793 Requisitions
* 2020 â€“ 66905 Requisitions
* 2021 â€“ 74310 Requisitions
* 2022 â€“ 82086 Requisitions
* 2023 â€“ 86227 Requisitions

There is a trend with the number of requisitions processes yearly. 2018 is when Workday was first implemented so the number of requisitions is the lowest for that reason. 2019 is the year where the requisitions were processed the most pre pandemic. There were a lot of students enrolled so departments have the funding to spend their money. Purchasing was busy during that year. 2020 is where everything changed. 2020 has the lowest number of requisitions processed. The reason for that huge decline from 2019 is that the pandemic had occurred. ASU had to basically go online, and the university was almost shut down in many ways. Campus was very empty. Because there were not as many students on campus, departments did not really spend as much of their money. As the pandemic started to subside, there number of requisitions started to increase every single year. 2023 has the most requisitions processed. This is the year where the university felt normal before the pandemic.

## What is the Total Amount of all Requisitions per year since 2018 ?

 
* 2018 â€“ $348,200,512.82 All Departments spent around 348 million dollars this year in 2018.
* 2019 â€“ $727,505,051.34 All Departments spent around 727 million dollars this year in 2019.
* 2020 â€“ $579,614,994.83 All Departments spent around 580 million dollars this year in 2020.
* 2021 â€“ $674,275,522.28 All Departments spent around 674 million dollars this year in 2021.
* 2022 â€“ $840,200,614.57 All Departments spent around 840 million dollars this year in 2022.
* 2023 â€“ $1,049,170,380.03 All Departments spent around 1 billion dollars this year in 2023.

The trend is just the same as the number of requisitions departments submitted and processed. Department spends lots of money until the pandemic hits in 2020 where ASU is kind of shut down. As the pandemic ends, the spending slowly increases and now in 2023, All departments spend over 1 billion dollars on anything for ASU. I predict all departments will spend even more money in the future.
Conclusion
Since there is no pandemic now, I believe ASU will increase the enrollment. More enrollment means more tuition means more money, meaning departments must purchase things that will go to the purchasing team that will keep us busy. I predict that more requisitions will be processed in 2024 than this year 2023. I believe there will be more Purchase Orders issued in 2024 than 2023. I also believe that departments will spend even more money on Goods/Services, Scientific, Technology, and Construction purchases. I predict every year purchases will increase but more slowly in the long run.

## How Many Requisitions I have Processed since I started at ASU ?


I have processed **6,137** requisitions since starting in the ASU purchasing department. That is a lot of requisitions processed. 

## What Is the Total Amount of All of the Requisitions I Have Processed Since Starting at ASU ?


Departments spent **$24,898,610.91** so around 25 million dollars with the requisitions that I have processed.

## How Many Requisitions That I have Processed That are Under $25,000?  


I have processed **5,847** requisitions that are $25,000 and under. These represent most of the departmentâ€™s purchases. I have move away from processing these the longer I work in purchasing. If I do an under $25,000 requisitions, it would be the oldest one first

## What Is the Total Amount of All of the Requisitions I Have Processed That are Under $25,000?


Departments spent **$15,952,662.19** on purchases that goes to me under $25,000.

##  How Many Requisitions That I have Processed That are Over $25,000? 


I have processed **290** requisitions over $25,000. High dollars requisitions are more time consuming because they require more documentation and if the purchases use federal money, then even more documentation is needed so that the departments justify their purchase. That involves reaching out to the department to obtain more documentation. Processing high dollar requisitions is the biggest priority for the Strategic Partnerships team in that we get trained in how to do these first before going to low dollar. These requisitions have a steeper learning curve with learning which documentation is needed but are easy to master eventually. The hardest part is making sure departments have the right documentations because they donâ€™t always provide what we wanted.

The reason the number is lower because purchasing in general doesnâ€™t get a lot of high dollar requisitions in general. Departments would want a PO generated before creating separate requisitions usually low dollar to pay for invoices in which explains why Purchasing gets so many low dollar requisitions. Also, Strategic Partnerships is a huge team. Including myself there are 6 team members not including higher ups. And the work load gets evenly distributed and everyone in the team knows how to process over $25,000 requisitions. The number of requisitions has increased over time and will continue to increase in the future.


## What Is the Total Amount of All of the Requisitions I Have Processed That Are Over $25,000?


Departments spent **$15,375,117.64** on purchases that goes to me over $25,000.

## How Many Requisitions That I have Processed That are Over $100,000?

 
I have processed **zero** requisitions that are over $100,000. The reason for this is because requisitions over $100,000 do not go to our team in Strategic Partnerships. Those over $100,000 requisitions route over to the Sourcing Team in which they exclusively deal with over $100,000 requisitions.

## What Is the Requisition Lowest Amount I did?

 
The lowest amount I have done on a requestions is zero dollars. Those requestions can either be a zero-dollar discount, Attachments or anything written the requisition needs to go to the suppler after the purchase order is generated, an agreement need to be signed and sent to the supplier or an agreement term needs to be extended. 

## What Is the Requisition Highest Amount I did?


The lowest amount I have done on a requestions is **$99,934.84** dollars. It is close to $100,000. This is a lot of money. I have seen some requisitions that are exactly $100,000 that reach strategic partnerships. We usually reassign those requisitions to the sourcing team.

## What is the Average Total Amount of Requisitions Overall I did ?


The average amount I did on requisitions is around **$5,104.74**. This proves a majority of requisitions that come to Strategic Partnerships are under $25,000. 

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed That Used the Requisition Type of Goods and Services ?


For the Purchasing Department to generate purchase orders that is needed to go to the supplier that automatically accepts ASU terms and conditions in order to be used as a contract, departments will choose the requisition types of Goods and Services, Chemical, or Technology. I generated **954** Purchase Orders from requisitions that use Goods and Services. Strategic Partnerships donâ€™t get as much requisitions that uses goods and services because departments will sometimes want to purchase to issue Purchase Orders that are of high dollar amounts and then want to pay for each of the goods and services separately with the requisition type of Pay an Invoice.

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed That Used the Requisition Type of Technology?


I have processed **170** requisitions that use the requisition type of technology. That means 170 purchase orders have been issued. They are treated the same as goods and services, but they just require a security review while goods and services donâ€™t. 

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed That Used the Requisition Type of Pay an Invoice ?


A Pay an Invoice requisition type is used for purchases or services that have already happened. Suppliers will provide departments with an invoice and purchasing checks if departments provide an invoice document. I have done **5,011** requisitions that are Pay an Invoice any amounts. Purchasing must approve Pay an Invoice requisition for departments to pay for their purchases. Pay an Invoice is that requestion type that I approved the most. The Pay an Invoice requisitions is the requisition type that our team Strategic Partnerships sees the most. Purchasing always want departments to generate PO before using Pay an Invoice.

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed That Used Other Requisition Types?


I have processed **64** requisitions of the other requisition types. All the other requestions type route to different teams within Purchasing. The only other requisition type that Strategic Partnerships do is Chemical. These go to material management after approval. The chemical orders are chemicals that are hazardous if people are not careful handling it. These requisitions are rare to see, but are treated just like a Goods and Services Requisitions. 

## How Many Requisitions I Have Processed Every Year?


* 2022 â€“ 2069 requisitions have been processed by me in 2022
* 2023 â€“ 4068 requisitions have been processed by me in 2023

The trend is that the number of requisitions that I have been processing have increased. As years go on if I still stay in purchasing the number of requisitions that I have processed will plateau and stay close to the same because departments can only submit so many requisitions and I also have more teammates taking on requisitions other than myself.

## What Is the Total Amount for All the Requisitions I Have Processed Per Year ?


* 2022 â€“ Departments spent $5,660,838.79 so around 5 million dollars with the requisitions that I have processed in 2022.
* 2023 â€“ Departments spent $25,666,941.04 so around 25 million dollars with the requisitions that I have processed in 2023.
  
The trend is that the amounts from the requisitions are increasing every year. In the future the amounts will increase every year since I had taken on higher dollar requisitions.

# Conclusion

Since there is no pandemic now, I believe ASU will increase the enrollment. More enrollment means more tuition means more money, meaning departments must purchase things that will go to the purchasing team that will keep us busy. I predict that more requisitions will be processed in 2024 than this year 2023. I believe there will be more Purchase Orders issued in 2024 than 2023. I also believe that departments will spend even more money on Goods/Services, Scientific, Technology, and Construction purchases. I predict every year purchases will increase but more slowly in the long run.
